# Game-of-Life
In tribute to John Horton Conway, who died of Covid on April 11, 2020. \
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. \
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. \
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. \
It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
